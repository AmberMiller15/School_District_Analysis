# School_District_Analysis
Preparation of standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
## Summary of Findings
- With the data provided, the overall average math score, the average reading and math scores of each type, and the overall population and budget of each school were found. This data determined based on average math and reading scores that both charter and public schools are performing at equivalent levels and with very similar budgets, with grades dropping the higher the grade level. 

## Additional Analysis
- While this Data provides a good overview of the performance of the schools in question, there are some additional analysis that could be performed that would better demonstrate this. An analysis of population of each type of school would show the size of each data pool. A comparison of average math and reading grades and population of schools would be helpful to see how the size of class affects the scores of the students. A comparison of the the budget and overall grade averages would help determine if the size of budget might effect the scores. The addition of these analysis would help the school make informed decisions on how to help improve test scores within the district, as well as help determine if the budget needs to be evaluated to better allocate funds to reading and math departments to help their students improve in these areas.
